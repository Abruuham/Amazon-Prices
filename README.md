# Amazon Prices

This project was written in Python in order to practice web scraping:

  - Tracking a certain Amazon prodcut's price throughout the day
  - Sending emails to provided email with updates when the price drops below the desired price

### Tech

This project is solely using the Python programming language. I also used BeautifulSoup4, requests, re  and notify for this project.
**Download BeautifulSoup4:**
```sh
$pip install beautifulsoup4
```
**Download Requests**
```sh
$pip install requests
```



### Try it out

All you need to run this project on your computer is git and an IDE of your choice that can run Python applications. I am using IDLE to write this. You can download Python from here https://www.python.org/downloads/.

To clone this project, what I did first was create a folder on my machine where I wanted to download the project to. Then, copy the directoy of the folder that you just created. 
Open a terminal and "cd" into the folder. Then follow the steps below:

```sh
$git init
$git pull https://github.com/Abruuham/Amazon-Prices.git
```

And that is it!

If you dont want to use git, then just click on the "clone or download" button and download the .zip file to your computer.



### Todos

 - Allow for multiple items to be tracked
 - Create a GUI in Python to make the application more user friendly
